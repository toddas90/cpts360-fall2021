                 Date Assigned: 10/14/2021
        DUE & DEMO: ALL Levels: close week Dec 9, 2021

         Submit a zip file of your work on Dec 9, 2021
                

  1. Level-1    : 11/12/2021
     Level-2    : 12/02/2021
                    
  2. May work in 2-person teams. However, a comprehensive INTERVIEW will 
     be given to EACH individual during the DEMO. The INTERVIEW results
     will be a major part of your final grades.

       ----------------  Project grading standards: --------------------
          Full credit   : Working AND can EXPLAIN your work.
          1/2 or better : Partially working but can EXPLAIN your work.
          0 and REPORT case to EECS: working but CANNOT EXPLAIN code.
       -----------------------------------------------------------------

                     A. OBJECTIVE:
   Design and implement a Linux-compatible EXT2 file system.

                     B. SPECIFICATIONS:
   Implementation of EXT2 File System: Chapter 11.6

		    1. Files:
   Files are exactly the same as they are in the Linux file system, i.e.
   we shall use the same EXT2 file system data structures for

      SuperBlock, GroupDescriptor, Bitmaps, Inode, Directory

   EXCEPTIONS:
      Only DIR and REG file types; no SPECIAL files.
      File size : No triple-indirect blocks.
   
2. Disks:
    Disks are "virtual disks" simulated by Linux files.  
    Disk I/O are simulated by Linux read()/write() operations on a BLKSIZE 
    basis. You may use Linux's mke2fs to create virtual disks

3. File names:
   As in Unix, each file is identified by a pathname, e.g. /a/b/c or x/y/z.

   If a pathname begins with "/",  it's relative to the / directory.
   Otherwise, it's relative to the Current Working Directory (CWD) of the 
   running process (see Processes below). 

4. Processes:
   Every file operation is performed by a process.
   The simulator starts with TWO processes:
       A process P1 with uid=0 (for SUPERUSER), and
       A process P2 with uid=1 (for ordinary user).
   The CWD of both processes are initially at the root directory /
  
   P1 runs first. It is used in Level-1 and Level-2.
   P2 is needed only in Level-3 for permission checking.

   All processes executes the same code (i.e. the FS project), in which it

       loop forever{
            prompt for a command;
            execute the command;
       }
 
5. File System Commands and Operations:
   File operations will be executed as commands. The required commands are 
   listed below. LEVEL 1 is the MINIMUM requirements for passing.
    
              -------  LEVEL 1 ------------ 
                      REQUIRED:
	       mount_root; ls, cd, pwd
               mkdir, creat, rmdir, 
	       link,  unlink, symlink, readlink

                       MINOR                      
               stat,  chmod, utime;

	      -------  LEVEl 2 -------------
	              REQUIRED:
              open, close, read, write, cat, cp,
		       MINOR:
	            lseek, mv

              -------  LEVEl 3 ------------ 
                      REQUIRED:
	       mount, umount, cross mounting points
               File permission checking
              -----------------------------
      
   All commands work exactly the same way as they do in Unix/Linux.

1. OVERALL: ~cs360/samples/PROJECT
            simulator.bin: The File System Simulator for EXT2 FS. 
            diskimage    : a virtual FD disk containing DIRs and FILEs
  Download and run the simulator on diskimage to see what I expect of YOUR work.
