                  DUE & DEMO: 10-7-2021

============================================================================
                  PART 1: Web Programming

1. YOUR WEBSITE at 69.166.48.15:
   Each of you has a user account on the Linux server machine IP=69.166.48.15

        login name = YOUR last name in lowercase 
        password   = YOUR WSU ID number

Copy file to your account: scp filename YOURNAME@69.166.48.15:public_html
		   
NOTE: The server machine is NOT administered by WSU systems people.
      If you have any problem with login or webpage, contact KCW directly.

2. Access YOUR website by http://69.166.48.15/~YOURNAME
   You will get a webpage, which looks like the following.    
        ------------------------------------
        |    Welcome to YOUR Website       |
        |       ------------------         |
        |       | YOUR PICTURE   |         |
        |       ------------------         |
        | Input command  :  BOX            | 
        | Input filename1:  BOX            |
        | Input filename2:  BOX            | 
        | Submit command :  Submit BOX     |
        ------------------------------------

3. You will NOT like your current picture. 
   login to your account by ssh YOURNAME@69.166.48.15
   Change it to YOUR pretty picture. Please use a real (JPG) picture of you

4. You may enter strings to the input boxes. When you click the Submit BOX,
   it submits the input strings to the httpd (Apache) server on the server
   machinee, directing it to execute

	     ~kcw/cgi-bin/mycgi.bin 
 
  which constructs a new webpage DYNAMICALLY and sends it back to your browser.
  As of now, it only echos YOUR inputs.

5. login to your account. YOUR home directory contains:
 
        public_html --- index.html 
               |
	   cgi-bin ---- mycgi.c util.o

Modify the index.html file to direct it to execute YOUR mycgi.bin program. 
Then run   cc -o mycgi.bin mycgi.c util.o   # generate YOUR OWN mycgi.bin executable.
           chmod u+s mycgi.bin              # chmod mycgi.bin to a SETUID executable

YOUR mycgi.bin program is executed by an Apache process (uid=80) on the server.
 
When a process executes a SETUID program, it temporarily assumes the uid of 
the program owner, allowing it to write to the owner's directories.

6. Access YOUR webpage again. Enter command and filenames. Then, Submit.
   It should execute YOUR mycgi.bin program in YOUR cgi-bin/ directory.

<h2>======================= REQUIREMENTS ===============================</H2>
7. MODIFY mycgi.c to do the following file operations AND generate 
   DYNAMIC webpages containing YOUR results.

     mkdir dirname
     rmdir dirname
     rm    filename
     cat   filename
     cp    file1 file2
     ls    [directory] <== if no directory, ls CWD

============================================================================
		   
PART 2 : Network Programming using TCP

Download files from samples/LAB4pre/ :  server.c   client.c
The programs are EXPLAINED and demonstrated in class
			   
=================== DO these: No need to turn in ======================
Modify client.c to send a line containing two numbers, e.g. 123 456
Modify server.c to compute the SUM of the numbers and reply 123 456 sum=579
