	Project Level-3: Permission Checking

1. Permission bits in INODE:
                                       |own|grp|oth|
   Recall that INODE.i_mode = |tttt|ugs|rwx|rwx|rwx|
                                       |permissions|

   Access to file is governed by permission bits

2. Permission Checking in General: access() return 1 if permission OK, 0 if not

int access(char *filename, char mode)  // mode = r|w|x:
{
  int r;

  if (SUPERuser: running->uid == 0)   // SUPERuser always OK
     return 1;

  // NOT SUPERuser: get file's INODE
  ino = getino(filename);
  mip = iget(dev, ino);

  if (OWNER: mip->INODE.i_uid == running->uid)
    r = (check owner's rwx with mode);  // by tst_bit()
  else
    r = (check other's rwx with mode);  // by tst_bit()

  iput(mip);
  
  return r;
}

2. USE of access() in FS functions:

getino(filename): must have r,x permission on every DIR during search()

cd_ls_pwd :  must have x and r permissions

mkdr_creat:  must have rwx to parent directory

rmdir     :  must be owner

link o n  :  must have rwx on oldfile, rwx to new parent

unlink    :  must be owner
  
open f m  :  must have m permission to file


3. Simplified Requirements for Project

Switch process to run P1 whose uid = 1, so it's not a superuser process.

		    Modify
cd newDir: allow cd to newDir only if has x permission
rmdir    : must be owner of removed dir
unlink   : must be owner of the unlinked file
