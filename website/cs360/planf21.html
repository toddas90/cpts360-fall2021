COURSE CONTENTS:
  Introduction to Unix/Linux and MTX Operating Systems: 
     Files, directories, special files, logical organization of 
     Unix file system; user account, login process and command
     execution.

  Program development
     Source files;  compiler, assembler and object files; 
     linker, library and executable files; loader and execution 
     images. Symbolic debugger and run-time support.

  Execution image of C programs
     Code, data and stack segments; function calling convention, 
     stack frames and parameter passing; long jumps.

  File I/O
     System calls and low-level file I/O; open, close, read, write, 
     lseek, file descriptors and file sharing. Execution of User 
     mode and Kernel mode images, implementation and implications 
     of system calls.

  File Control
     Permissions and access control, fcntl, chown, chmod, hard 
     and soft links, file status and statistics.
     I/O redirection, pipes, filters and applications.

  Standard I/O Library
     Streams and high-level file I/O; user space buffering, 
     relationship with low-level I/O,  char and line mode I/O. 
     Formatted I/O.

  File system implementation
     Inodes and file representation; mkfs and physical file 
     system layout; traversal of the file system tree; booting 
     system images.

  Processes
     Concept and implementation of processes, process execution 
     environment, user mode and kernel mode images, process
     states transitions. Processes in the Unix system; init, 
     login and user processes.

  Process Control
     fork, vfork, wait, exit, kill, exec operations. traps and 
     signal handling.

  Process Synchronization and Communication
     Signals, pipes, semaphores, messages and shared memory 
     segments. Sockets.

  Concurrent Programming
     Threads and parallel programming
 
  Networking
     Introduction to Internet; host, address resolution, 
     routing; protocols, client and server; ftp, rlogin, nfs, 
     and nis, Socket Programming. 

  Project: To be announced later

  Misc Topics: sh and Perl programming, Linux system administration.
